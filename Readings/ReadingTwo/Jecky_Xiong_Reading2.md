I enjoy this idea of sound being a medium for art, because I believe that making sound is, indeed apart of art. 
Especially when someone can add something even more extreme to compliment sound. Nic Collins, I feel, does this extremely well. 
His work with producing sound with strange yet interesting instruments that he created, brings a whole new level to this idea of 
music and sound. Nic Collins is a composer that creates electronic music that is experimental and different than the average 
contemporary music in pop-culture. While his works are interesting, I personally do not like his works, but I can appreciate 
it as a fellow artist. It might just be because I was born in a generation so used to the mainstream, that seeing something 
extraordinary might give indifferent feelings.

And like I stated above, I believe that sound is a great medium for art creation, because of how abstract it can become. 
You can take any sound and edit it in so many ways that it will not sound how it would originally sound and thatâ€™s why I 
think the idea of synthesizers are so amazing. I enjoy the piece they put into the interview that was made by Alvin Lucier, 
because the fact that all he did was record a monologue and in the end, it became this melodic sound piece is astonishing. 
Sound art and technology goes hand in hand. Most of the time, sound art uses technology in its process, whether its recording 
it, displaying it, or modifying it. The creation of sound art may even spark new technological pieces, like what Nic Collins
did with his <i>Tobabo Fonio</i> piece.

All in all, sound art is intriguing, and a very creative medium like any other medium. Nic Collins shows that well with 
his work and while opinions differentiate about liking his work or not, it is still appreciated in the whole of things. 
Sound art is something that can be awkward getting into I believe, but ultimately in the end, it can become something worthwhile.
