Try to think about how sound can be a medium for art. Who is Nic Collins? Do you like his work? Can sound be used as an interesting medium for art creation and how is sound art related to technology?

Please post your responses by next Friday and as always, if you have any questions you can stop by my office hours on Tuesdays from 12-2 or eamil me: andrew.blanton@sjsu.edu.
