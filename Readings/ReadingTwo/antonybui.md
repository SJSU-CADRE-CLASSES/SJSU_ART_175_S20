#Sound art

I believe sound is art. Mostly music being art because I love music a lot. There are some songs that are just above the rest, whether it be lyrical or tunes. Albums are a whole package as there is a piece of artwork associated with it as well as songs that fit within. 
“Nic Collins is a Professor in the Department of Sound at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.” He invented certain musical devices and seems to find ways to hack cd players.

His work is interesting and unique but I wouldn’t say I am a big fan of it. I wouldn’t go out of my way to see it most likely because it’s similar to “ear rape.” Very loud sounds that I don’t enjoy. It is interesting as it is a different take on making sounds and somewhat unconventional. I remember doing something similar with Eric when we had the whole room with the circuits to ourselves. I would create some interesting but annoying sounds. I knew it was somewhat annoying but I had some fun with it.

I think sound is very important to gaming. If the sound works for certain elements, the game feels a lot better and vice versa. The music is also very important in all games and makes the game more memorable. 

Sound Technology is difficult as you need to know the human body and mind. How does one create certain feelings through sound? I think this question should be asked when working with sound technology.
