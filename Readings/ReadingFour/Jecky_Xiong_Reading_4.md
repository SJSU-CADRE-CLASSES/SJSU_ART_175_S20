The article showed many artist’s who’s works were interesting in terms of concept and design. A lot of the works shown had 
artists who made their own instruments, almost like synthesizing real world objects rather than through the normal means
with wave signs. While all the works are superb, there are definitely some that interested, or captivated me more than 
the others. Samson Young’s piece is a powerful work of art and the concept is astonishing. He is combing the idea of war 
and sound and it shows how important how sound is in warfare. While it does not commentate on the warfare, it sends an 
interesting message to the public. Cevdet Erek’s piece was quite calming. To be able to create something that sounds like 
the ocean with only a piece of carpet is fascinating. This piece is almost meditative and something about it just calms the
mind, as the sound of the ocean kind of does. Carsten Nicolai’s piece is amazing. It reminds me of audio visualizer, but to 
have it more tangible is awesome. The usage of water to reflect the neon lights is a cool concept and then to use the sound
frequencies to alter the water is such an amazing idea. Florian Hecker’s piece is interesting in terms of the science behind 
it. The idea of placing the mirrors to alter the sounds coming from the speakers is interesting, unfortunately I’m not fond 
of the sounds that are being played. I really love Susan Philipsz’s piece. It reminds me of sirens, especially because the 
piece is placed under a bridge with water. It is mesmerizing, almost as if I can just sit near the water and listen to the 
audio for hours. I like the idea of Tarek Atoui creating his own instruments and then creating a composition to make a final 
piece. I do not enjoy his performance, but that’s not relative to what I think of the piece. Christine Sun Kim’s piece is simple, 
yet exciting, because the viewers are basically going on a hunt to find different kinds of audio. I think Camille Norment’s piece 
is awesome, but unfortunately, I don’t think seeing the piece in video form truly shows the piece in its best form. I think being 
there in person will be a more amazing experience because then, I will be able to see the glass vibrate to the sounds in the room. 
Janet Cardiff’s piece, I did not fully understand. While I think it is interesting, I feel like it is more of a piece that you just 
sit and listen to. I might be wrong and I hope I am, otherwise I think it’s still a good piece. Hamdan’s piece is definitely a 
powerful piece of art. The way it is presented is quite astonishing and clearly commentates on political issues. Lastly, Thessia 
Machado’s piece. I really like the idea of creating music machines. Her process is quite an interesting one. I took a look at the 
piece that was linked in the article, and I can agree that the composition is quite unsettling, but in a good way. All in all, the
works shown were amazing sound art pieces. I think it will be a lot better to see these in person as to experience art in person
is honestly the best way to intake the art itself. To be able to recreate some of the works will definitely be difficult, but a 
lot of the sound can be made using synthesizers, but I prefer to make my own, rather than to copy off of someone else. Maybe 
with like the piece by Susan Philipsz, I can imagine it being on a beach side with the audio of a female voice, again trying to 
invoke the idea of sirens in the sea. Overall I believe these pieces are amazing and I wish I can see them in person.
