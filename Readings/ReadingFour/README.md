Hi All,

For Friday please read and look at the artist in the following article and respond to the works. Please write about what you think of the works, do you find them interesting?

Also, think about how you might recreate some of the works or if you were to produce a version of any of these work, what might it look like?

Please post your response to the class Git by the beginning of class on Friday.

Andrew
