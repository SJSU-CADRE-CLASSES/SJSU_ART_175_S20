Today, sound is an interesting and abstract medium since it utilizes a sense that can’t be seen or felt. Sound art is direct since the audience simply has to hear it and it can affect emotions.

1. I found Samson Young’s piece unsettling. Utilizing drums to recreate the sound of bomb explosions made me feel anxious and uneasy since war can be a scary topic. I found his use of non-musical instruments such as the can of compressed air and razor interesting since these objects fulfilled a different use than their intended purpose.
2. Cevdet Erek’s piece was very soothing to me. I grew up by the ocean so the recreation of the sound of the ocean is very relaxing to me. 
3. I really enjoy Carsten Nicolai’s piece and the light visuals are relaxing. I think it is an interesting idea utilizing sound that can’t be heard to create these visuals. Sound is typically something that can’t be seen, yet in this art piece, the ripples of the water visualize the sound for us.
4. Florian Hecker’s installation had some eerie sound effects. I feel like this is a piece I’d have to experience in person to understand further. From the video, it was more difficult to tell how the mirrors affected the sounds of the speakers.
5. Susan Philipsz’s piece is beautiful to me. The singer’s voice echoing by the water and bridge definitely creates a calming atmosphere. I can imagine myself in these locations just reflecting on life with this sound softly in the background.
7. I did not find Tarek Atoui’s performance very interesting. His live performance seemed overdramatic to me while the sounds he produced just sounded like a bunch of electronics to me, which wasn’t very interesting. I feel like this piece could have benefited from an audio visualizer rather than using his own body as the visualizer itself.
8. Christine Sun Kim’s piece seems like something fun to try out in person. To me, the most interesting part about this piece is the fact that the artist has been deaf since birth. It is fascinating to find someone working with a medium featuring a sense they can’t use themselves. It’s like a painter who has been blind since birth. 
9. I like the visuals of Camille Norment’s installation. The glass windows shattered everywhere creates a very chaotic atmosphere, as if an earthquake or some kind of disaster just shattered them all. The sound component creates a haunting vibe of the aftermath of this destruction.
10. Janet Cardiff’s piece is interesting and I feel like this is also another piece that should be experienced in person to feel it in full effect. Each speaker replaces a human and to me this piece is about humanity being replaced by machinery. There is an interesting dichotomy between each speaker being something electronic, yet there’s a human voice coming out of each one.
11. Lawrence Abu Hamdan’s piece is unsettling. There is something eerie about these images just slowly approaching you. The humming sound used to imitate the sound of CCTV recordings just further adds to the eerie atmosphere. 
12. Thessia Machado’s pieces were not very interesting to me. The machines she made created all these sounds, yet I felt like the sounds they produced were pretty simple while the visuals just looked like a lot of wires and machinery.
