One of the most expressive works I’ve seen is a live performance from a Brooklyn-based music duo  [Ariadne](https://vimeo.com/ariadnesound) comprised of Christine Papania (voice, electronics) and Benjamin Forest (electronics). They explore the intersection of mysticism, dream analysis and the failure of digital systems through intricate musical compositions and sound interactive art.  In their 2018 performance in [B4bel4b Gallery](https://www.b4bel4b.com/), Oakland, I was impressed by the monochrome and sacred 3D scene, which was interactive with their vocal-based music. By using Unity and Touchdesigner, they are able to manipulate the striking visuals through live sounds data and provided poetry and dramatic experience to the audiences. Their music is a avantgarde blend of electronic, metal, and opera. Ariadne has become one of my favorite experimental bands since then.

Aside from live performance and video-based pieces, installations from [Anthony Discenza](http://anthonydiscenza.info/) and [Christina Kubisch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2Yjfdnbtgw) encourage me to consider embeding digital experience into physical spaces, as well as the potential of sound beyond visual. 

In his work, [The Companions: Sounds of Lost Screenplay](https://deyoung.famsf.org/companions-project), Anthony and sound designers Gary Rydstrom and Josh Gold designed an immersive and directional sound installation in the [Hamon Tower Observatory](http://anthonydiscenza.info/the-companions-sounds-for-a-lost-sceenplay) of de Young Museum. Based on a 1980s screenplay, <i>The Companions</i>, this “auditory cinema” reveals the vital role sound plays in shaping narrative and affective space in a film, and the possibility of creating cinema without moving images. The missing film and image in this work open the imagination of visual to the viewers, moves them through a thematic, narrative, and atmospheric interpretation in the tower.

[Cloud](https://www.sfmoma.org/read/christina-kubisch/), form Christina Kubisch, is a sounds sculpture made by thousands of feet of red electrical wire, hosts a fourteen-channel composition. To interact with the work, visitors wear customized headphones, which contain magnetic coils that receive the magnetic fields circulating in the cable loops, and move around the sculpture to listen. As Kubisch’s explaination: “The basic idea of these sound spaces is to provide the viewer/listener access to his own individual spaces of time and motion. <i><b>Cloud</b></i> is not only a visualization of digital sound process and cloud computing, but also transforms the visitors from passive viewers to mixers who iterate this artwork continuously through their movement.
