For next class, please read the following essay: http://andrewblanton.com/Experimental_Abstract_Film.pdf

It's a short history on Experimental Abstract Film and should be an interesting place to start our conversation for this semester. Have you ever seen any works that combine sound and visuals? Do you know of any artist or artworks that do this in an interesting way?

Please write an (approx) 400 word response to this essay discussing the works that you have seen or who you think does a good job in working with both sound and visuals.
