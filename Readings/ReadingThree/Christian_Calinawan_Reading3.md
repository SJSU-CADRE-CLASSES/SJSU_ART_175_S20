In her Glitch Manifesto, Rosa Menkman writes about new and improving technologies and how they will always have traces of imperfection. Menkman states that even though most people who experience these flaws see them as negative traits, she believes these imperfections allow and facilitate for new opportunities. She then writes about how early artists utilized these imperfections to their advantage within their own artwork. She supports straying away from the intended uses and norms of a program and exploring and being experimental instead. Using the code outside of its intended way and thinking outside the box creates interesting artwork. She believes in utilizing the glitch as a progress. It shifts an object away from its ordinary form into something brand new. This manifesto is an example of Menkman breaking the norms of the english language to create something unique. In her writing, she breaks sentences and words in ways that interrupt the flow of proper grammar. She does this as if she were glitching the writing itself, yet it was written like this intentionally. This is glitch art. Works within this genre break the boundaries of norms and beliefs and twist them into something completely new. Glitch art alters the normal, creating something new and destroying the original one. Destruction and corruption is still an act of change, yet the new glitched art still contains remains of its original source.
