Will make a interactive max patch. Through multislider, I want to make the canvas look like glaexy. Then, I will create a sound for each constellation. I will record the sound of Korean, and try to distort. People can click their Astrological sign and hear the sound and see. And the base sound will be pink noise.

Title: Polaris

Description:It is easy to find the Big Dipper in the sky, and it makes it easier to find Polaris. Polaris gives direction to travelers in many years, decades, and eras. If you see a bright star next to the Big Dipper, it indicates North. Likewise, I have my own Polaris. Whenever I get lost, my family and friends give me hints of the right direction, and it makes me keep walking forward and find my way out. 
My grandfather, who supported my dream the most, passed away last year while I was studying abroad. His last words were, “Since Soovin is in her final week, please do not tell her.” He is still my hero, dream, and star. I always think of him when I accomplish something or want to quit studying abroad. Even though I cannot reach my family (physically), grandfather and my friends, their emotional support helps me with pursuing my dreams in the States. I wanted to create a work about longing and direction. Therefore, I projected Max screen on my ceiling with the mixed sounds, which is Kiki, Xiao and I recorded in class activity before shelter in place order. The sound is playing backwards and mixed, and it includes my hope of going back to the past when we could hear the harmony of the crowd's noise and nature.

Overall, I got inspired from one of my favorite poems, The Night I Count the Stars by Dong-ju Yoon.

“...To a star memory

To a star love
To a star loneliness
To a star yearning
To a star poem
To a star mother, mother
 
Mother, I whisper a beautiful word to a star.

They are too far away.
As far as the stars.
