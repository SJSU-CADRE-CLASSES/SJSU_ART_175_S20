Idea For Final

3 Main take aways

1. The first aspect of my project has to do with hardware hacking and repurposing toys from my childhood to something that I am currently interested in as an adult

2. Most of the toys that exist are marketing abstractions of nature in the sense that they generally are colorful anthropormorphic representations of naturally occuring forms, I want to place these hacked items into the wild where they can be in direct contrast with the enviroment.

3. I also want to place these objects on hiking trails due to that being a high source of traffic given these times of quarantine
