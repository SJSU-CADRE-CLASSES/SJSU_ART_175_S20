For the final project I decided to create a live audio reacting piece, because I wanted to experiment with live audio and how I can create a 
3D visual for the sound. As this is an idea for my BFA Project, I wanted to experiment and find what works and what does not. So far, I figured out that 
the sound signal is quite low, so I need to find a way to increase the signal value so that the visual is more reactive to the sound that is coming in.
I was always interested in music and sound as a visual and how it can change visuals. I'm also interested in VJs and how all the visuals are
manipulated live as well. Overall, I wanted to test my abilities and find something that involves sound and art together.
