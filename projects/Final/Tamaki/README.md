I would expand my last sound visualization project, 
incorporating dial sounds everyone is familiar with.
The concept behind this piece is to explore our identity in the digital world.
Your telephone number is a crucial part of your identity; you need a phone number whenever you need to register your identity. The ten digits numbers speak to society more than your name.
Everyone remembers their phone number as if it is a part of your body. 

The goal of my project would be to create a visualization of dial sound based on your phone number. You would be able to put your phone number and see unique sound visualization to individuals.
