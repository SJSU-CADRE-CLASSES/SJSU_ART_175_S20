I created a crossfade using two different videos , one being the American Flag I created out of buttons and the other being money burning. 
I wanted to create an artpiece that would show what is happening in America lately with how certain rich people are basically able to burn their money on non-essiantial stuff instead of their employees or to better the lives of others.
One of these rich people would be Jeff Bezos who spends billions on space travel and insists that it is the only way that he would be able to spend some of the money he gets every day.
It seems as though no matter how hard certain people work, it is near impossible to get rich or have enough time for other things in life anymore. 
I wanted to create the button flag as a way to show how we view the flag and the video to show what is really happening behind the scene.
