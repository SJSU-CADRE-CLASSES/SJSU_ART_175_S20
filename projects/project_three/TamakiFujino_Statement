Using the makenote object and grabber from vizzie, I created a soud visualization.
The movie of live video camera of your laptop changes its hue, saturation, lightness and pixel.
By using the counter object the scale of piano changes one by one continuously.
You can let the random object and counter object play the piano and change the effect of the video, 
but also you can simple pick one of the key from the piano and see the change of the effect of video.
