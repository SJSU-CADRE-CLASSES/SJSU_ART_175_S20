For the second project of the semester you are asked to create an audio visual artwork utilizing the concepts and objects we have studied up until this point. Working with the objects [button] [number] [message] [pack] [pak] [unpack] [zl] [metro] [random] [noteout] [patcher] [scale] [print] [trigger] [delay] [float] [int] [+] [-] [/] [*] [slider] [comment] [counter] [urn] [drunk] [pipe] [makenote] [midiformat] [bpatcher] [prepend] [append] [scale] [change] [clip] [pattr] [s] [r] [table] [itable] [loadbang] [cycle~] [buffer~] [dac~] and [gain~] specifically, use only these objects to create your work. Projects should be visually interesting and pay attention to form, color and design. This project will be due on 3/14 and should be ready for a brief walk through at that time. Please document the output of your project and post 2 to 3 images to the class git repo. Also post as a short description of your project approximately 200 words in length. In your description, please describe formal and visual elements or your work including texture, color, and any other formal aspects of your final output. Also provide any historical influences you might have considered.

As always if you have any questions or concerns technically or conceptually feel free to contact me: andrew.blanton@sjsu.edu or come to office hours at Art 311 from 12-2 p.m. on Tuesdays.
