# Let The City Dance
Let lights and sounds dance
Let trees and skyscrapers dance
Let walkers and commuters dance
Let the busy and the leisure dance 
Let our love and our loss dance
Let the regreteful and the joyful dance
Let the hateful and the struggles dance
Let our works and hobbies dance
Let the city dance
Let our life dance

I'm obsessed with the hidden energy of a city. The energy is rich and being shaped by residents and visitors, by the natural landscape and human-made architecture, by the hustle of daily life, by the accident happened on the roads, and the parade planned on the streets, by the noise which is not always noisy, and the by gossip that always amuses me, by the giant light rail beast and the necessary automobile-pet, by the ghostly commuters and reckless walkers.
By women and men, human and animal, and natures, by you and me.

Let the city dance, dance with the city.
